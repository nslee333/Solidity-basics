This is where I'll write notes and at the end of the tutorial, I'll
explain the code line by line and explain what it's doing.

Part 6.

We're going to go over two topics in this tutorial.

How to use both Math and Libraries in Solidity.

1. Libraries.
2. Math.

We use libraries to manage math in Solidity frequently.

A library is a way to organize code that can be used in multiple 
places inside your project.

We basically use it to DRY our code.

DRY is an acronym for Don't Repeat Yourself.

For example, if we have a function that we're going to use inside of
multiple smart contracts we can create a library
