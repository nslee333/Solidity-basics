In this video, we're going to go over how to write a function that
accepts ether.

How can we send Ether in when we call function and do stuff with it.

First we're going to create a function called buyToken.

This function is going to emulate what happens at an ICO, or a crowd
sale or pre-sale on Ethereum when you buy ERC-20 tokens.

We're going to create a way to track the persons balance.

We're going to do that with a mapping (associative array), with the
address being the key and the value being a uint.

We are going to set the visibility of the array to public.

In the buyToken function we're going to modify the data in the 
balances array, and whenever the person buys the token we're going
to increase the balance count by one.

balances[msg.sender] += 1;
