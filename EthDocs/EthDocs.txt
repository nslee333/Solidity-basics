Introduction:

This is going to be my notes and code from going through the Solidity/
Ethereum Documentation.

The plan is to write notes and make sure I understand the material, 
and develop my knowlege as a developer.

Intro to Ethereum.

What is a blockchain?

A Blockchain is a public database that is updated and shared across
many computers in a network.

"Block" refers to data and state being stored in consecutive groups
known as blocks.

If you send Eth to someone else, the transaction data needs to be 
added to a block to be successful.

"Chain" refers to the fact that each block cryptographically 
references its parent. In other words, the blocks are chained together.
The data in a block cannot change without changing all subsequent 
blocks, which would require the consesus of the entire network.

Every computer in the network must agree upon each new Block and the 
chain as a whole. These computers are known as 'Nodes'. Nodes
ensure everyone interacting with the Blockchain has the same data.
To acomplish this distributed agreement, blockchains need a consensus
mechanism.

Ethereum currently uses a proof-of-work consensus mechanism. This 
means that anyone who wants to add new blocks to the chain must
solve a difficult puzzle that requires alot of computing power.

Solving the puzzle 'proves' that you've done the 'work' by using 
computational resources. Doing this is known as mining. Mining is 
typically brute force trial and error, but successfully adding A
block is rewarded in Eth.

New blocks are broadcast to the nodes in the network, checked
and verified, thus updating the state of the blockchain for everyone.

So to summarize, when you send Eth to someone, the transaction must
be mined and included in a new block. The updated state is then shared
with the entire network.

SHA256 Hash

A hash looks like a random string of numbers and letters, but 
essentially what it is, is a a digital fingerprint of some digital 
data.

// I'm entering my own notes here on SHA256.

SHA256 stands for Secure Hashing Algorithim. 

It is used by IPFS as its main cryptographic hash algorithim, that is
used essentially as a "fingerprint" of the data, or barcode.

SHA256 is determanistic, meaning, that the data that is input into it
it will always get the same hash everytime. 

E.g. I typed in my name 'nathan' into this generator:

https://passwordsgenerator.net/sha256-hash-generator/

and it spit out D2653FF---------------------.

Everytime I go into it, and type the same "nathan" it will always
return the same hash D2653ff.
