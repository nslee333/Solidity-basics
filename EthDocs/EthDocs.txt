Introduction:

This is going to be my notes and code from going through the Solidity/
Ethereum Documentation.

The plan is to write notes and make sure I understand the material, 
and develop my knowlege as a developer.

Intro to Ethereum.

What is a blockchain?

A Blockchain is a public database that is updated and shared across
many computers in a network.

"Block" refers to data and state being stored in consecutive groups
known as blocks.

If you send Eth to someone else, the transaction data needs to be 
added to a block to be successful.

"Chain" refers to the fact that each block cryptographically 
references its parent. In other words, the blocks are chained together.
The data in a block cannot change without changing all subsequent 
blocks, which would require the consesus of the entire network.

Every computer in the network must agree upon each new Block and the 
chain as a whole. These computers are known as 'Nodes'. Nodes
ensure everyone interacting with the Blockchain
