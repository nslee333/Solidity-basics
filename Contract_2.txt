Introduction

This is the second smart contract for this tutorial:

----------------------------------------------------------

The first thing we're going to do in this video is that we're
going to update the contract code that we wrote before to to the latest
version of solidity.

Solidity 0.5.1.

Okay so we can read the error in remix IDE, and it gives us two
type errors.

TypeError: data location must be "memory" for return parameter in function but none was given.

The error is noted at line 19 and line 25.

All we have to do to fix this error is to add memory to the return parameter.

Using the Remix IDE, we compiled the contract and the error is fixed.

Now we're going to get going on the main focus of this video, we're going to
be covering the basic data types and data structures in Solidity.

First thing we're going to go over is the different ways we can go over
state variables.

At the top of the contract we have the state variable 'string value'
that we declared and set it and retrieved the values.

Solidity has a shortcut where you don't even need the get function.

You can basically read it for free.

We're going to add the public keyword on the end of the state variable.

The public keyword is declaring the visibility of the state variable.

After compiling the code, and deploying it onto a blockchain we can see it on the remix
IDE that you can read the code for free.
