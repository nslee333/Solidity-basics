// -----------------------------------

// Introduction


// Solidity is a contract-oriented, high level programming language for implementing smart contracts.
// It is is influenced by C++, Python and Javascript.

// Smart contracts are the main way you organize code, store data and write all of your programming logic. 

// Solidity is used to run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Which is the engine that is used to run the code on the 
// Ethereum Blockchain.

// Solditiy is statically typed, it supports inheritance libraries and a bunch of other stuff.

// a Smart Contract is code that gets executed on the blockchain.
// So in this case, the Ethereum Blockchain.


// This Smart Contract is kind of like a mircoservice out on the web.
// It's accessible to everyone on the Blockchain. 

// So since it's on the Ethereum Blockchain, everyone will be able to see the smart contract.
// Anyone can see, or use the smart contract, they'll be able to read and write data with it.
// And also execute any code inside of here.
// It's all public.


// Its a microservice because it's more than just a class in an object-oriented system.
// It's publically accessible. 

// ----------------------------------------


// function get();

// When we write the string value, we are actually writing data to the Blockchain.
// The Variable in the string is stored in this smart contract.
// It's different from an local variable inside of a function, that would only be local to that function scope.

// This value is stored on the blockchain.

// Setting the visibility of this function, setting the function to public
// Expands the visibility or the scope of the function

// the public keyword makes the function visible and usable by anyone who
// has access to the smart contract on the blockchain not just inside this contract.

// Returns string character, this tells our function that we will always return a 
// string datatype.

// The value type is declared as a string in the function 

// ----------------------------------------------------

// function set();

// One thing to note is that on this second function, we used an underscored
// '_value' parameter so that we don't get the 'value' from the first function mixed 
// in the contract.

// The string 'value' declaration at the top of the contract is the state variable.
// The 'value', is a state variable, which is being written to and stored on the Blockchain.

// Solidity knows that the '_value' is a local variable because I passed it in and prepended
// and understore to the beginning of the variable.

// Also note that we declared the data type of function argument we need that
// inside solidity because it needs to know the type of the data that is getting
// passed in.

// Okay so now, we have two functions in this smart contract. 
// One to read the value and a function to set the value, (Or write the value if you prefer.).
