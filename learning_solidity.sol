// Solidity is a contract-oriented, high level programming language for implementing smart contracts.
// It is is influenced by C++, Python and Javascript.

// Smart contracts are the main way you organize code, store data and write all of your programming logic. 

// Solidity is used to run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Which is the engine that is used to run the code on the 
// Ethereum Blockchain.

// Solditiy is statically typed, it supports inheritance libraries and a bunch of other stuff.

// a Smart Contract is code that gets executed on the blockchain.
// So in this case, the Ethereum Blockchain.


// This Smart Contract is kind of like a mircoservice out on the web.
// It's accessible to everyone on the Blockchain. 

// So since it's on the Ethereum Blockchain, everyone will be able to see the smart contract.
// Anyone can see, or use the smart contract, they'll be able to read and write data with it.
// And also execute any code inside of here.
// It's all public.


// Its a microservice bececause it's more than just a class in an object-oriented system.
// It's publically acessible. 

// When we write the string value, we are actually writing data to the Blockchain.
// The Variable in the string is stored in this smart contract.
// It's different from an local variable inside of a function, that would only be local to that function scope.

// This value is stored on the blockchain.

// The public keyword on the function is used to
